Since then, numerous large-scale epidemiological studies conducted across the globe, including a 2013 CDC study involving hundreds of thousands of children, have found no evidence of a causal relationship between any vaccines and the likelihood of developing autism.",

    "document": "Scientific models and satellite data confirm that the Amazon rainforest generates a significant portion of its own rainfall through a process called evapotranspiration. Large-scale deforestation disrupts this water cycle. A study in 'Geophysical Research Letters' showed that areas with significant forest clearing experienced a measurable decline in precipitation and a longer dry season, directly linking the loss of trees to changes in weather patterns.",
